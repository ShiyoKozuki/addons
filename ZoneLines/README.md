# ZoneLines v1.1.0 - Zone Line Visualizer for Ashita v4.3

Zone line visualizer for Ashita v4.3. Draws 3D ground markers at zone transition boundaries so you can see where zone lines are before walking into them. All zone line data is pre-extracted from FFXI DAT files.

## Features

- **846 Zone Lines** across 198 zones, pre-extracted from FFXI DAT files
- **3D Depth-Tested Markers** - Dots render in world space and hide behind walls/terrain
- **Terrain-Following** - Dots follow pre-computed navmesh ground heights with cliff flattening
- **Pulsating Glow** - Configurable dot pulse with adjustable speed, intensity, and min/max brightness
- **Distance Color Coding** - Optional green/yellow/red coloring based on proximity
- **Destination Labels** - Zone name and distance displayed above each zone line
- **Flexible Label Layout** - Distance position (top/bottom/left/right), configurable spacing and separators
- **Circle Markers** - Portals and trigger-area transitions shown as ground circles with vertical poles
- **Per-Zone-Line Overrides** - Adjust height, trim, flatten, hide, and pole height per entry
- **Supplemental Triggers** - Hand-curated entries for script-driven transitions (palace gates, tower portals)
- **Settings Window** - Full ImGui UI with tooltips on every control
- **Per-Character Settings** - Saved automatically via Ashita's settings system

## How It Works

### Data Sources

1. **zones_data.lua** - 846 zone line bounding boxes extracted from FFXI DAT files
2. **supplemental_zones.lua** - Hand-curated trigger-area transitions
3. **terrain_heights.lua** - Pre-computed ground heights from navmesh data

### Data Extraction

The addon's data files are pre-generated offline — no extraction happens at runtime.

**Zone Lines (zones_data.lua)** - Extracted from FFXI's DAT files using a Python script. Each zone has a DAT containing RID (Room ID) entries with a `z` prefix identifier (e.g., `z020`, `z05a`). The script scans the VTABLE/FTABLE to locate each zone's DAT, parses the RID entries to find zone line bounding boxes (position, size, rotation), and decodes the 4-character FourCC identifier using base-36 encoding to determine the destination zone ID. Mog House entrances also exist in the DATs using `zm` prefix identifiers (e.g., `zmrw`, `zms0`) with `to_zone=0`. The result is 846 oriented bounding boxes across 198 zones with positions, dimensions, rotation angles, and destination zone IDs.

**Terrain Heights (terrain_heights.lua)** - Extracted from LandSandBoat's Detour navmesh `.nav` files. A Python script reads the navmesh polygon data for each zone, then for each zone line bounding box, samples ground heights at evenly-spaced dot positions along the line. It uses point-in-polygon ray casting to find which navmesh triangle each point falls on, then barycentric interpolation to compute the exact ground height. Edge-first sampling with cross-fill fallback handles cases where dot positions fall slightly outside the navmesh. Post-processing applies slope outlier clamping and edge extension to smooth out gaps.

**Supplemental Triggers (supplemental_zones.lua)** - Hand-curated from LandSandBoat server scripts. A few zone transitions use trigger areas instead of standard walk-through boundaries, so they don't have RID entries in the DAT files. Currently covers the Northern San d'Oria bridge entrance to Chateau d'Oraguille and the Heaven's Tower portal in Windurst Walls. Positions and extents are sourced from LSB's `Zone.lua` trigger area definitions.

### Rendering

Zone lines are rendered as 3D primitives using D3D8 `DrawPrimitiveUP` in the `d3d_beginscene` event (pass 2, before game world geometry). The game's depth buffer naturally occludes markers behind walls and terrain. Text labels use a screen-space ortho projection with the font atlas texture for pixel-perfect rendering while preserving depth testing.

For passage-type zone lines, hovering dots are drawn along the wider dimension of the oriented bounding box, interpolating pre-computed terrain heights. Circle markers are used for portals and area triggers, with a vertical pole connecting the ground circle to the label above.

### Ashita SDK API

| Interface | Methods Used | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **IEntity** | `GetLocalPositionX/Y/Z(idx)` | Player position for distance calculation and camera reference |
| **IParty** | `GetMemberZone(0)` | Zone detection, character login gate |
| **IResourceManager** | `GetString('zones.names', id)` | Destination zone name resolution |
| **GetPlayerEntity()** | `.ServerId` | Character identity for per-character settings |
| **AshitaCore** | `GetInstallPath()`, `GetMemoryManager()`, `GetResourceManager()` | File paths, access to memory interfaces |
| **D3D8 Device** | `DrawPrimitiveUP`, `SetRenderState`, `SetTransform` | World-space 3D marker rendering with depth testing |
| **ImGui** | `GetFont()`, `GetFontSize()`, `GetFontBaked()` | Font atlas texture for D3D text rendering |

## Settings

Settings are saved per-character via Ashita's settings library.

### Labels
- **Labels** - Show/hide destination zone names
- **Distance** - Show/hide distance in yalms with position control (top/bottom/left/right)
- **Label Gap** - Spacing between zone name and distance text
- **Font Size** - Base font size multiplier
- **Label Height** - How far above dots the label floats
- **Min/Max Zoom** - Font scale limits based on distance

### Dots
- **Glow Pulse** - Enable pulsating dot halos with configurable speed (0.5-20)
- **Pulse Min/Max** - Brightness range for the pulse cycle
- **Glow Intensity** - Overall glow brightness multiplier
- **Dot Size** - Size of each dot in world units
- **Dot Glow** - Edge glow intensity (0 = sharp, 1 = solid)
- **Dot Spacing** - Distance between dots along the zone line
- **Hover Height** - How far above ground dots float
- **Cliff Flatten** - Max height change per dot before flattening slopes

### Colors
- **Dot Color** - Base color for all dots
- **Distance Colors** - Toggle proximity-based coloring (far/mid/close)

### Per-Zone-Line Overrides
- **Hide** - Hide specific zone lines (e.g., door-activated transitions)
- **Height** - Vertical offset adjustment
- **Trim** - Inset dots from edges (avoid railings/walls)
- **Cliff Flatten** - Per-entry slope flattening override
- **Pole Height** - Vertical pole height for circle markers

## File Structure

```
zonelines/
  zonelines.lua          -- Main addon: metadata, events, commands, settings
  renderer.lua           -- D3D8 rendering: depth-tested dots, circles, text labels
  ui.lua                 -- ImGui settings window with per-zone-line overrides
  data.lua               -- Data loading: zone lines, supplemental triggers, terrain heights
  zones_data.lua         -- 846 pre-extracted zone line bounding boxes (auto-generated)
  supplemental_zones.lua -- Hand-curated trigger-area transitions
  terrain_heights.lua    -- Pre-computed ground heights from navmesh data
```

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- **Pre-computed data**: All zone line positions and terrain heights are loaded once at startup, not computed per-frame
- **Zone caching**: Zone line data is cached per zone with a dirty flag, only recomputed on zone change or settings mutation
- **Pre-allocated D3D matrices**: Identity and ortho matrices are allocated once at module level, not per-frame
- **Reusable label table**: Label collection uses a counter pattern with table reuse to avoid per-frame allocations
- **Settings gating**: Color rebuilds and setting syncs only run when settings change, not every frame
- **D3D state skip**: Render state save/restore cycle is skipped entirely when no zone lines are within render distance
- **Transform safety**: D3D transform matrices are saved as Lua table copies to prevent cdata staleness when restoring
